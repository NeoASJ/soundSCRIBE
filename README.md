# Audio Transcription and Dual Summarization App

This project is a local web application designed to transcribe audio files, generate two types of text summaries‚Äîa technical concise summary and a vivid, narrative summary enriched with analogies and examples‚Äîand convert the vivid summary into an audio playback. It leverages advanced AI models including OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text conversion and Hugging Face Transformers for summarization, all integrated through a user-friendly Gradio interface.

---

## Features

- **Audio transcription:** Accurately convert speech from audio files (MP3, WAV) into text using Whisper.
- **Technical summary:** Produce a clear, factual, and concise summary ideal for technical or expert readers.
- **Vivid summary:** Generate an engaging, illustrative summary that includes storytelling elements, analogies, and vivid examples from the content.
- **Audio summary:** Convert the vivid summary into a natural-sounding audio file for listening on the go.
- **GPU support:** Utilizes GPU acceleration (CUDA 12.8 compatible) for faster processing if available.
- **Interactive UI:** Simple and fast web interface powered by Gradio for easy use.

---

## Requirements

- **Hardware:** NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.8 (recommended but not required; works on CPU)
- **Software:**
  - Python 3.8 to 3.11
  - Internet connection for initial model downloads
- **Memory:** At least 16GB RAM recommended for smooth performance

---

## Installation

1. **Download or clone the repository / script**

2. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment** (recommended):

python -m venv optoenv

Windows
optoenv\Scripts\activate

Linux / macOS
source optoenv/bin/activate


3. **Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.8 support** (adjust if no GPU):


pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128


For CPU only:

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio


4. **Install the other required packages:**

pip install gradio git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git transformers gtts


---

## Usage

1. Save the main application code as `audio_summarize_app.py`.

2. Run the script from your command line:

python audio_summarize_app.py


3. After the server starts, open the provided localhost URL in your browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).

4. Upload an audio file (MP3 or WAV) using the interface.

5. View the full transcription, the technical summary, the vivid summary, and listen to the audio version of the vivid summary.

---

## Customization & Tips

- **Model size:** For systems with limited GPU memory, use smaller Whisper models such as `"small"`:

whisper_model = whisper.load_model("small").to(device)


- **Summary length:** Adjust `chunk_size`, `max_length`, and `min_length` parameters in the summarization pipeline to control summary granularity and length.

- **Audio summary:** To switch the audio to use the technical summary instead, replace:

tts = gTTS(text=vivid_summary, lang='en')


---

## Troubleshooting

- **First-run downloads:** Models will download during the first run‚Äîthis may take several minutes depending on your internet speed.

- **CUDA Compatibility:** Verify that your installed CUDA drivers and PyTorch CUDA version match your GPU‚Äôs capability to avoid runtime errors.

- **Memory Errors:** Lower model sizes, reduce chunk sizes, or run on CPU if you encounter GPU out-of-memory errors.

- **Package versions:** Ensure you have the correct versions of Python packages to avoid compatibility issues.
